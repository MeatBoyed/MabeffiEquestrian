        I am passionate about horses and have dedicated my life to sharing the
        joy of horse riding with others. Having spent over 15 years in the
        equestrian world, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge that I
        am eager to pass on to my students. I have successfully competed in both
        show jumping and dressage on a national level.

        part2="My teaching philosophy emphasizes safety, technique, and the development of a strong bond between rider and horse. I believe that horse riding is not just a sport but a way to develop important life skills such as discipline, confidence, and empathy."
