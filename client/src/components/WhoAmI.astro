        I am passionate about horses and have dedicated my life to sharing the
        joy of horse riding with others. Having spent over 15 years in the
        equestrian world, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge that I
        am eager to pass on to my students. I have successfully competed in both
        show jumping and dressage on a national level.

          With a focus on personalized instruction, I strive to create a
          positive and supportive environment for my students. Whether your
          child is a beginner or an experienced rider, I will tailor each lesson
          to their individual needs and goals.

          My teaching philosophy emphasizes safety, technique, and the
          development of a strong bond between rider and horse. I believe that
          horse riding is not just a sport but a way to develop important life
          skills such as discipline, confidence, and empathy.
