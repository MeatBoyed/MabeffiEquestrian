        I am passionate about horses and have dedicated my life to sharing the
        joy of horse riding with others. Having spent years in the equestrian
        world, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge that I am eager
        to pass on to my students. I have successfully competed in shows and
        have honed my riding skills to a high level.
